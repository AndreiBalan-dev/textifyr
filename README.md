## üöÄ Project Overview

**Textifyr** is a cutting-edge web application that allows users to generate subtitles for videos using advanced AI-driven transcription. This project was developed during the Headstarter Hiring Hackathon 2 event held on August 24-26, 2024.

This tool provides users with an easy way to transcribe audio from videos, generate subtitles, and then embed these subtitles back into the video. It is a fully-functional proof-of-concept showcasing potential premium features like higher video quality, additional fonts, and more customization options in a production environment.

## üåü Inspiration

Inspired by the need for accessible video editing tools, Textifyr was created to make subtitle generation effortless and efficient. Despite the limited time, the project demonstrates the potential of combining AI, video processing, and web technologies.

## üîß Built With

- **React (TypeScript)**: For building the dynamic and interactive user interface.
- **Flask**: To handle API requests and serve the React app.
- **Whisper (by OpenAI)**: For AI-driven transcription of video audio.
- **MoviePy**: To generate and embed subtitles in the video.
- **Gunicorn**: For serving the Flask application in a production environment.
- **Nginx**: As a reverse proxy to handle requests and serve static files.
- **FFmpeg**: For video compression and processing.
- **ImageMagick**: For handling image operations required in video processing.

## üß© Features

**AI-Driven Transcription**: Generate accurate subtitles using Whisper by OpenAI.
**Video Processing**: Embed subtitles directly into videos.
**Customizable Subtitles**: Choose from different fonts, sizes, colors, and spacing options.
**Securization & Authorization**: Ensure API requests are secure with secret tokens.

## üéÆ How to Run Locally

### Clone the repository:

npm run build
```


### Update your global settings:

Modify **path.json** and **settings.json** in the root directory.
Modify your secret API token in secret.json if you require so.

### Ensure FFmpeg and ImageMagick are installed and accessible:
### Ensure you have fonts available in server/fonts. I am not able to share them here as the fonts are licensed.
### Edit your code in client/src/components/SelectText.tsx accordingly to what fonts you are using.

**For Linux - Ubuntu:**

```bash
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg imagemagick
```

### Run the development server:
